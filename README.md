# Bookstore Specification

This is to serve as a reference point for expressing a Software Requirements Specification (SRS).

The approach taken is a unique and experimental one.

It is intended as a one person project:
* Original Idea
* Specification
* Design
* Implementation
* Testing
* Deployment

Enjoy!
