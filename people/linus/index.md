## Linus Torvalds

> I will, in fact, claim that the diﬀerence between a bad programmer and a good one
> is whether he considers his code or his data structures more important.  
> Bad programmers worry about the code.  
> Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.  
> **Linus Torvalds**
