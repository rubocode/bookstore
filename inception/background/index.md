## Background

> I had this Sri Lankan friend.  
> **Jeff Bezos**

I wanted to use a susbstantial example for illustrative purposes.
I wanted to avoid having to teach domain knowledge of the example while
trying to crystallize the requirements gathering process.

Everyone is familiar with online bookstores — the quintessential example being
how Jeff Bezos got started on Amazon as an online bookstore.
Jeff's first technical employee was Shel Kaphan who laid the foundation for Amazon.  
It seemed like such a rich example to illustrate intial requirements gathering.

Many _agile_ proponents seem to advocate the avoidance of considering the
big picture at the start of a software development project.
They give you the false confidence that you can start with a user story called
_Customer buys Product_ and figure out the rest of it by getting continuous
feedack from the customer.  In my opinion, this is a grave mistake.

You need to have enough of a big picture view in adequate detail to make
the project successful.  The narrow specialists of today don't even want to
know the big picture.  They leave it to the customer and the project manager
— both of who usually lack enough technical knowlegde.

> Many soldiers are led to faulty ideas of war by knowing too much about too little.  
> **George S. Patton**

Here, I take the opposite and holistic view.  If two guys at Bell Labs could
come up with a foundational programming language and an operating system that
have thrived for more than a half a century, why can't I write a software system
for a mom & pop bookstore all by myself!

Isn't it worthwhile to figure out how to go about doing that!

From soup to nuts!
