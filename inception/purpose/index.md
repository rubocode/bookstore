We are going to create a _Software System Definiton (SSD)_ for a fully
digital Mom & Pop Bookstore.

Fully digital means that all inventory and transactions are stored in
a digital database and all transactions including both customer-end and
staff-end are done through the digital system.

A Mom & Pop Bookstore means that there is only one location of the bookstore.
One of the implications of this criteria is that it enables us the option
to provide a fully LAN-based solution that is not a web application.

A vital ramification in allowing the possibility of either a web-based solution
or a LAN-based desktop solution is that we need to capture the requirements
at a higher level of abstraction.

One set of definitions of _events_ and _objects_ that enable at least
two very different technical _designs_.

A worthy, noble and challenging endeavor!
